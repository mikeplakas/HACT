                    of Tourism, an organization with roots dating back to 1989. Today, respecting its historical
                    past, it is redefining itself, adopting a new identity, a fresh vision, and a deep commitment
                    to promoting Greek culture, spirit, and tourism experiences.

                    Fam Trips, B2B meetings, Press Trips, Seminars and representation at the largest tourism

                    Our vision is to highlight Greece not as a tourist destination, but as a lifelong destination,
                    experience and connection. Our goal is to reconnect people with Greece as a spiritual,
                    cultural, and humanitarian ideal.
